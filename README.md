## Installing the Packages

## Configure React Router
- As I have used React Router here to navigate between some pages. This Router has a base URL hardly coded inside the ```src/App.js``` file. Please replace your ```basename``` found inside this App.js file(line number ```43```) with yours. As my demo URL is in a subdirectory(https://zonayedpca.github.io/react-micro-blog) called ```react-micro-blog```, I have used the ```basename``` as ```/react-micro-blog```. Please configure yours accordingly.

## Configuring Homepage
- Same for the production version, I have added a field called ```homepage``` inside package.json file. Please replace it with yours if you want your production version to work properly.
